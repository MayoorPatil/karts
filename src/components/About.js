        <p>Hi my name is Kylee Schadler and thanks for checking out my website. Im from NH but have
traveled and lived abroad.</p> <p>My design aesthetic is influenced by Asian and Indian culture, as well
as the Art Deco period.</p> <p>I use materials from local shops as well as internationally, and try to buy
nickel free or stainless steel posts to be as hypo-allergenic as possible.</p> <p>You can also find my
jewelry at <a href="http://jayschadler.com/">Jay Schadler Studio</a> in Portsmouth, NH.</p> <p>Thank you again for checking me out and feel free to contact me with any
questions or comments.</p></h4>
