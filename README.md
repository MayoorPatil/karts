# My second Project at GA code school - Full Stack Project

-   This is `KArts` a jewelry shopping application.
-   The application allows users to view different types of locally home made jewelry items and purchase
-   Its a responsive single page application primarly built using `React Framework` and `Ruby on Rails`
-   This is my final Capstone project here at GA. Here is the link to the [`KArts Repo`](https://github.com/MayoorPatil/karts)

In the future plan is to include support for the following:

-   Allow users to delete only those orders that are in open status
-   Allow users to add items to an open order
-   Allow admnistrators of the site to manage orders
-   Allow to purchase with CC information
-   Keep track of cart items for signed-in users

I am open to feedback and suggestions. If you have any please connect and share

2.  GIT for code repository and version control
3.  ATOM javascript editor
4.  Ruby on Rails is used to build the backend APIs
    -   Here is the link to the [`Backend Repo`](https://github.com/MayoorPatil/mayoor-capstone-rails-api)

## Development Process

Here is how I approached the development of this application

1.  Had the requirements broken down into user stories and also had a basic wireframe created
2.  Based on that I did some pseudo code and spent some time designing the flow of the application
3.  Then I built basic html file so that I could start coding the backend APIs. I targted this challenging part first since I was comfortable with other aspects of the project such as integrating the ajax service calls and displaying the response received from the API back to the users
4.  With every little change I made i unit tested all along to minimize defects and fixes. This helped a lot as I was able to identify minor defects and fix along the way.
5.  All along I also ensured every feature was committed and pushed to the GIT repository. This was specifically helpful since I knew exactly what had changed with each feature and did not have to struggle and go through a ton of code to fix or implement any missing functionality
6.  Not to mention there was a lot of react learning involved as this was something new and challenging. But it was exciting!
